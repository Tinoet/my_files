    <!-- tsc filename.ts: compiles the code to javascript -->

    <!-- rootdir: specifies the dir that contains our sourcepath(./src).move the ts file to the src -->
    <!-- in the emit: there is the outdir(./dist) and this specifies the dir that would hold our js files -->
    <!-- remove comments: enable it to remove all the comments that we type in our typescript: so the generated javascript code will be shorter -->
    <!-- noEmmitONError: enable it to prevent the ts from generating any typescript files -->
    <!-- after the config settings we just run the tsc instead of index.ts to compile all js file in the project-->

        debugging: to run code line byy line to see what happens wen our code does not work as expected:
        sourcemap:enabling it shows how each line of our typescript code maps to the generated js code
        go to the generated file and see the mapping

    <!-- creating a breakpoint helps the code to stop debugging when it reaches that breakpoint -->
    <!-- move to the debug console and create a lanch.json file: that tells vs code how to debug applications
     -->
     <!-- the variable contains the details of the files we are debugging -->
     <!-- any file that we cant see we create it at the watch list -->
